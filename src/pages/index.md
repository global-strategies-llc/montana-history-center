  The Department of Administration planned to build the new Montana Heritage Center at the
  alternative site of Roberts and 6th it is not suitable.

  It will fail in its mission to become a world-class museum since it is right in the middle
  of all the government buildings where there is not enough room to build a large museum.
  We won't be able to share our history and culture with Montana’s school children and the
  thousands of visitors who come to Montana.

        We currently support locating the Montana Heritage Center at the former Capitol Hill Mall site.
        It is centrally located, close to the Capitol, and has plenty of room for future expansions, parking, and outdoor exhibits

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
