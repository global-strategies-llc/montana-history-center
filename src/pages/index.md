    The proposed name and location for the new Montana Historical Society
    museum.
  question: What Is The Montana Heritage Center?
description: >-
  The Department of Administration planned to build the new Montana Heritage
  Center at the alternative site of Roberts and 6th it is not suitable. It will
  fail in its mission to become a world-class museum since it is right in the
  middle of all the government buildings where there is not enough room to build
  a large museum. We won't be able to share our history and culture with
  Montana’s school children and the thousands of visitors who come to Montana.
  The mall site was the original proposed site and is the prime location.

      We currently support locating the Montana Heritage Center at the former
      Capitol Hill Mall site. It is centrally located, close to the Capitol, and
      has plenty of room for future expansions, parking, and outdoor exhibits.

      To me it’s as simple as "location, location, location" the three words
      most important to business success. Do not expand in the current Capitol
      area.
