  The Department of Administration planned to build the new Montana Heritage Center at the
  alternative site of Roberts and 6th it is not suitable.
  It will fail in its mission to become a world-class museum since it is right in the middle
  of all the government buildings where there is not enough room to build a large museum.
  We won't be able to share our history and culture with Montanaâ€™s school children and the
  thousands of visitors who come to Montana.
  The mall site was the original proposed site and is the prime location.
