        After Helena became the capital city of Montana, the historical
        collection was moved from Virginia City to Helena in 1874.
      question: Why will the Montana Heritage Center be built in Helena?
    - answer: >
        Absolutely.


        The mall site is located between Prospect Avenue and 11th avenue and
        provides easy public access. It can accommodate parking spaces for
        school buses, the Helena tour train, and RVs.


        The alternative location at Roberts and 6th would not be able to
        accommodate all visitors and their vehicles.


        The mall site provides a lot more room for the new Montana Heritage
        Center and will offer a massive increase of historical artifacts to be
        seen on display.
      question: >-
        Is the mall site large enough to accommodate the requirements of the
        Montana Heritage Center?
