                Helena Resident
        quote: >-
          The Heritage Center should be located where it has a public presence as
          Montanans and tourists enter Helena and it should not be located on an
          out of the way side street.

          The history of Montana should stand alone, not be mixed with government buildings.

          Our new Heritage Center would be much more accessible to those who travel in RVs
          if it was placed at the Capital Hill Mall.

        quote: >-
          As it says in the brochure, the Montana Heritage Center will be a "Montana Tourism
          Centerpiece". It won't just benefit Helena, but will help our economic development
          throughout the state. I hope when complete, the bucking horse by Scriver, the "Symbol of
          the Pros" will be placed near the front entrance so the tourists and all who come here
          will see it first thing. I urge your support and my best wishes for success with this
          project.

          With an admitted bias that derives naturally from seven years of studying history in
          college, I enthusiastically support the effort to fund the expansion of the Montana
          Historical Society and museum. The current society, museum and itâ€™s publications and
          outreach as well of the desire of the people of the Treasure State to our past - and our
          future.

          I, like all Montanans, have a keen interest in the history of our state and in making sure
          we utilize the tools available to share that history and and culture with Montana school
          children, with other residents of our great state and with the thousands of visitors who
          come to Montana to enjoy "The Last Best Place."

          The development of a new Montana History Center would be the most extra ordinary and
          significant gift  Montana and its citizens and will create a lasting legacy for future
          generations. I hope you share in the knowledge what a precious value our history has in
          our rich Montana heritage, and support the effort of this statewide campaign.

          Understanding the past helps us feel connected to a generation of long ago and gives our
          lives deeper meaning. Education, especially education that teaches an appreciation of the
          past, is a key to the preservation of our freedom and civilization.

          worthwhile endavour. Your support through this bond will enable the Montana History
          Foundation to better leverage support from the public help with this project. The Montana
          Historical Society has been invaluable in setting standards that all Montana Museums look
          to in their operations. The Museums association of Montana works closely with the MHS to
          convey professionalism to all musuems in the state. In showing the commitment to provide
          for the expansion of the needed space and the ability to provide the proper care of the

          MHS lead in helping making the state wide museums important to our citizens and visitors

          As a publisher, author, university teacher and historian, I know how important the society
          is to preserving, protecting and advancing the cause of Montana history and heritage. I am
          well aware that the society has outgrown its current facility, and a new building is badly
          needed. The Society serves people all across the state, and it is a vital asset in many
          ways.
