    quote: >-
      As a publisher, author, university teacher and historian, I know how
      important the society is to preserving, protecting and advancing the cause
      of Montana history and heritage. I am well aware that the society has
      outgrown its current facility, and a new building is badly needed. The
      Society serves people all across the state, and it is a vital asset in
      many ways.
