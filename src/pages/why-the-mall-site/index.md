description: >-
  The Department of Administration planned to build the new Montana Heritage
  Center at the alternative site of Roberts and 6th it is not suitable. It will
  fail in its mission to become a world-class museum since it is right in the
  middle of all the government buildings where there is not enough room to build
  a large museum. We won't be able to share our history and culture with
  Montanaâ€™s school children and the thousands of visitors who come to Montana.
  The mall site was the original proposed site and is the prime location.

      As a publisher, author, university teacher and historian, I know how
      important the society is to preserving, protecting and advancing the cause
      of Montana history and heritage. I am well aware that the society has
      outgrown its current facility, and a new building is badly needed. The
      Society serves people all across the state, and it is a vital asset in
      many ways.
