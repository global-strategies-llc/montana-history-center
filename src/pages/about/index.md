Montanaâ€™s Unique History

"One of the greatest gifts you can give to future generations to inspire them with the knowledge of their own history and heritage."

Betty Babcock, Former First Lady of Montana



The Montana History Center wants to ensure that the historical treasures of Montana and the Montana Historical Society may provide an extraordinary legacy for future generations.

To ensure our legacy for future generations it requires the purchase of the land of the former Capital Hill Mall site. We are now at a historic juncture when we can decide to take the steps that future generations will remember with gratitude and pride.
